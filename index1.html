    </h1>

    <p> Pitt said, "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go
        for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain." Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without
        a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system</p>





    <h2> What is fight club movie about?</h2>
    <p>
        A depressed man (Edward Norton) suffering from insomnia meets a strange soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad
        Pitt) and soon finds himself living in his squalid house after his perfect apartment is destroyed. The two bored
        men form an underground club with strict rules and fight other men who are fed up with their mundane lives.
        Their perfect partnership frays when Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a fellow support group crasher, attracts
        Tyler's attention.
